/*
🔍 Key Concepts:
1. Static blocks are executed once when the class is loaded, before the main() method.
2. If there are multiple static blocks, they execute in the order they appear in the class.
3. These blocks are often used for static initializations (e.g., loading drivers, setting up config).

✅ Output:
Static Block-1
Static Block-2
Main Method
