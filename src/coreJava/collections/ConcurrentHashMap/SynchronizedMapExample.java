    /*
     ðŸ§  Key Points:
     - ConcurrentHashMap is designed for high concurrency and allows thread-safe operations without locking the entire map.
     - Unlike synchronizedMap, it does not require external synchronization during iteration.
     - It divides the map into segments, enabling concurrent access to different segments, improving performance.

     âœ… Highlights:
     - No need to use synchronized blocks with ConcurrentHashMap.
     - Thread-safe for put(), get(), remove(), and iteration.
     - Suitable for use cases with frequent reads and writes from multiple threads.
